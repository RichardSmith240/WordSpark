#WordSpark

## About
WordSpark is a Program to Promote Information Retention and Speed by flashing each work of an imported text in sequence at a set rate.

## Goals
I am using this project to learn c/c++ so features will not be done constantly (or maybe ever). This is a project to learn a skill and make something useful for studying.

Core Features:
- [ ] Fully Format the README
- [ ] Text Separator
- [ ] Text Speed Dial
- [ ] Full Display for Text
- [ ] Basic Media Controls

Features I **WANT** to implement:
- [ ] OCR Integration
- [ ] Speed Trainer/Diagnostics
- [ ] Comprehension/Retention Trainer/Diagnostics
- [ ] Text Simplification Using AI Summary
